#### Marble Insanity Models

These are the CAD models for all of the parts used to create the
physical assembly for my Fall 2015 Mechatronics I final project. The
software running the project and an overview of it are available
[in this repository][source-code]. These parts were fabricated from ABS
and acrylic, on a Makerbot 3D printer and Epilog Zing 24 laser cutter.
This repository includes both the original SolidWorks 2015 Education
Edition models as well as STL exports that can be viewed online or in
other programs.
